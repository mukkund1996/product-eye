# Web Application Testing Tasks

persona_navigation_task:
  description: >
    Navigate the web application at {app_url} using the {persona_type} persona profile.
    
    Steps to follow:
    1. Use the Persona Behavior Simulator tool to understand the {persona_type} characteristics
    2. Navigate to {app_url} and explore key pages following persona-specific behavior patterns
    3. Execute the provided testing instructions systematically, attempting each with the specified maximum attempts
    4. Document all interactions, observations, and any usability issues encountered
    5. Focus on areas most relevant to the {persona_type} user type
    6. Provide detailed findings that can be used for user interview simulation
    
    Output should include navigation path, user observations, pain points, and positive experiences.

      description: >
        A list of high-level tasks for the persona navigator to complete on the website.
        Each task should be approached according to the persona's natural behavior patterns.
        Tasks should be attempted with the specified maximum attempts before moving on.
      type: list
      required: true
      structure:
        - task: "High-level goal or objective to accomplish"
          priority: "high|medium|low"
          max_attempts: 3
          success_criteria: "General outcome that indicates task completion"
          fallback_action: "What to do if the task cannot be completed"
      example:
        - task: "Explore the main interface and understand the primary purpose"
          priority: "high"
          max_attempts: 3
          success_criteria: "Gain understanding of what the application does and how to navigate it"
          fallback_action: "Document any confusion about the application's purpose and continue"
        - task: "Engage with the core functionality as a typical user would"
          priority: "high"
          max_attempts: 2
          success_criteria: "Successfully interact with the main features of the application"
          fallback_action: "Document barriers to engagement and try alternative approaches"
        - task: "Find and use search or discovery features"
          priority: "medium"
          max_attempts: 3
          success_criteria: "Locate relevant content or information using available tools"
          fallback_action: "Document search limitations and continue with manual exploration"
  expected_output: >
    A detailed report of the navigation experience including:
    - Persona characteristics used for navigation
    - Testing instruction execution results (success/failure/attempts for each)
    - Pages visited and interaction patterns
    - Usability issues or friction points encountered
    - Positive experiences and smooth interactions
    - Technical observations (load times, responsiveness, etc.)
    - Specific quotes or reactions the persona might have had
    - Summary of completed vs. attempted instructions with retry counts

interview_simulation_task:
  description: >
    Based on the navigation findings from the persona_navigator, conduct a realistic
    user interview simulation that explores the user experience in depth.
    
    Steps to follow:
    1. Review the navigation findings and persona characteristics
    2. Create realistic interview questions based on observed interactions
    3. Simulate authentic user responses that reflect the navigation experience
    4. Probe deeper into pain points and positive experiences identified
    5. Focus on actionable insights for product improvement
    
    The interview should feel authentic and reflect the actual user journey observed.

**User Interview Transcript**

**Interviewer:** Thank you for taking the time to speak with us today! Could you start by describing your experience when you first accessed the Hacker News site?

**User:** Sure! When I first opened the homepage, I felt a bit overwhelmed. There seemed to be a lot of articles, and I wasn’t sure where to start.

**Interviewer:** What specifically made you feel overwhelmed?

**User:** I think it was the amount of links. They were all small and crowded together, which made it hard to focus on any particular one. 

**Interviewer:** I see. You were attempting to click on a specific article titled "Tiny Core Linux." Can you tell me about that interaction?

**User:** Right, I was curious about the title. I clicked on it, but nothing happened. I kept clicking, but it seemed like the link wouldn’t work.

**Interviewer:** That sounds frustrating. Can you describe in more detail what you were feeling at that moment?

**User:** Yes, I felt really confused. I didn't understand why I couldn’t click on it. I ended up trying to find other articles instead, but I still felt lost in navigation.

**Interviewer:** After trying to click on the article, how did you proceed?

**User:** I eventually just returned to the homepage. I looked for the back button, which took me a moment to find because the links are so small.

**Interviewer:** What were your impressions of the homepage layout once you returned?

**User:** Honestly, it still felt cluttered. Even though I was back at the homepage, I struggled to see the login button. I wanted to comment but had trouble finding what I needed.

**Interviewer:** Can you tell me how you felt about the login process?

**User:** It was kind of irritating. I had to look for it multiple times and I wished it was more prominent. I almost gave up because I thought I wouldn’t figure it out.

**Interviewer:** It sounds like accessibility was an issue for you. What suggestions would you have for improving the navigation experience?

**User:** I think the links should be bigger and spaced out more, so they’re easier to click. Also, a guide for new users would help to understand the layout better.

**Interviewer:** Those are fantastic suggestions. Is there anything else you think should be addressed?

**User:** Visual prompts or more distinct sections for articles would be great. Simply labeling things or breaking up text into shorter paragraphs could really help novices like me.

**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for your feedback! To sum up, you mentioned the overwhelming layout, issues with clicking links, and difficulty finding the login area. Would you agree those are your primary pain points?

**User:** Yes, definitely. It just seemed complicated for a first-time user. 

**Interviewer:** Thank you again for your insights! We appreciate your time and input.
